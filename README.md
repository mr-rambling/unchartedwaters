This will be an attempt to reproduce some of the trading functionality of the MMO Uncharted Waters Online.

1. Establish five fictional cities with semi-unique goods. Categorise these goods into general archtypes
2. Create a trading platform to buy and sell in each city
3. Establish distances of each city from one another
4. Create favoured goods for each city based on the distance travelled from point of origin
5. Introduce variability to pricing based on recently bought/sold goods
6. Introduce a degree of randomness to product demand in each city
7. Add travel time and costs to trading between cities
8. Add player functionality. Restrict cargo space and starting capital. 
9. Add player upgrades.
10. Welcome message to each city
11. AI generated talk from your ships crew each day at sea
12. PvE events while travelling
